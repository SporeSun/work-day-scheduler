# work-day-scheduler

## Description

A simple calendar application for time management. As someone who suffers with ADHD, I wanted both to apply my 3rd party API skills and make something that would be helpful for me. I built this project to serve anyone who needs a visual aid for time management. It solves being late on assignments. I learned to effectively use Day.js to make sure times and dates were correct and that colors on events changed appropriately. I learned exactly how local storage worked and how I was overcomplicating everything.

## Installation

## Usage
